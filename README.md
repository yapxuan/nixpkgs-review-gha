# nixpkgs-review-gha

Run [nixpkgs-review](https://github.com/Mic92/nixpkgs-review) in GitHub Actions

## Features
- Build on `x86_64-linux`, `aarch64-linux`, `x86_64-darwin` and `aarch64-darwin`
- Optionally build on `riscv64-linux` via the [RISE RISC-V Runners](https://riseproject.dev/2026/03/24/announcing-the-rise-risc-v-runners-free-native-risc-v-ci-on-github/) (off by default; requires installing the RISE GitHub App on your fork)
- No local setup
- Automatically post results on the reviewed pull request
- Optionally start an [Upterm](https://upterm.dev/) session after nixpkgs-review has finished to allow interactive testing/debugging via SSH
- Push new packages to an [Attic](https://github.com/zhaofengli/attic) or [Cachix](https://www.cachix.org/) cache
- After a successful review, automatically mark the PR as ready for review, approve it, or merge it (directly or via the [nixpkgs-merge-bot](https://github.com/NixOS/nixpkgs-merge-bot))
- Optionally use [Nix remote builders](https://nix.dev/manual/nix/latest/advanced-topics/distributed-builds) (either in addition to or instead of the local GitHub Actions runner).
- Add a "Run nixpkgs-review" shortcut to pull request pages in nixpkgs

## Setup
1. [Fork](https://github.com/Defelo/nixpkgs-review-gha/fork) this repository.
2. In your fork, go to the [Actions](../../actions) tab and enable GitHub Actions workflows.
3. If you want to set up [automatic self-updates](#automatic-self-updates-optional), please enable the `self-update` workflow ([Actions / `self-update`](../../actions/workflows/self-update.yml) > `...` button (top right corner) > `Enable workflow`).

### Post Results / Auto Approve/Merge (optional)
nixpkgs-review-gha can automatically post the results as a comment on the reviewed pull requests and approve the PR after a successful review out of the box by using an [nrgha-api server](api).
The default instance will use the [@nixpkgs-review-gha](https://github.com/nixpkgs-review-gha) account to create its report comments.
If you want to host and use your own nrgha-api instance, you can [create a new variable](../../settings/variables/actions/new) with the name `API_URL` and set its value to your base URL (without a trailing slash).

If you don't want to use the API server, or if you also want to be able to automatically mark PRs as ready for review or merge them on review success, you need to generate a [personal access token](https://docs.github.com/en/authentication/keeping-your-account-and-data-secure/managing-your-personal-access-tokens):

1. Go to <https://github.com/settings/tokens> and generate a new **classic** token with the `public_repo` scope.
2. In your fork, go to "Settings" > "Secrets and variables" > "Actions" and [add a new repository secret](../../settings/secrets/actions/new) with the name `GH_TOKEN` and set its value to the personal access token you generated before.

> [!WARNING]
> Tokens with the `public_repo` scope have almost full access to *all* public repositories, so they should only be used with great caution.
> Unfortunately it is neither possible to create a classic PAT with a smaller scope nor is it possible to use fine-grained tokens (which aren't *that* fine-grained anyway) here, so it is recommended to not add a `GH_TOKEN` and simply use the nrgha-api server which doesn't require any configuration on your end.

### Automatic Self-Updates (optional)
If you want your fork to update itself on a regular basis, you need to generate a [personal access token](https://docs.github.com/en/authentication/keeping-your-account-and-data-secure/managing-your-personal-access-tokens). Note that this token is different from the one used above!

1. Go to <https://github.com/settings/personal-access-tokens> and generate a new **Fine-grained token** token with access to only your fork ("Repository access" > "Only select repositories") and "Read and write" permissions for both "Contents" and "Workflows".
2. In your fork, go to "Settings" > "Secrets and variables" > "Actions" and [add a new repository secret](../../settings/secrets/actions/new) with the name `GH_SELF_UPDATE_TOKEN` and set its value to the personal access token you generated before.

### Push to Attic Cache (optional)
Follow these steps if you want nixpkgs-review-gha to push new packages to an [Attic](https://github.com/zhaofengli/attic) cache. Replace `$CACHE` with the name of your cache (e.g. `nixpkgs`) and `$SERVER` with the url of your Attic server (e.g. `https://attic.example.com/`):

1. Generate a token with `push` and `pull` permissions: `atticadm make-token --sub nixpkgs-review-gha --validity 1y --pull $CACHE --push $CACHE`
2. [Create a new variable](../../settings/variables/actions/new) with the name `ATTIC_SERVER` and set it to the value of `$SERVER`
3. [Create a new variable](../../settings/variables/actions/new) with the name `ATTIC_CACHE` and set it to the value of `$CACHE`
4. [Create a new secret](../../settings/secrets/actions/new) with the name `ATTIC_TOKEN` and set its value to the token you generated before.

### Push to Cachix (optional)
Follow these steps if you want nixpkgs-review-gha to push new packages to a [Cachix](https://www.cachix.org/) cache. Note: If both an Attic cache and a Cachix cache is configured, the Attic cache is preferred and the Cachix configuration is ignored.

1. Go to https://app.cachix.org/ and set up your binary cache.
2. [Create a new variable](../../settings/variables/actions/new) with the name `CACHIX_CACHE` and set it to the name of your Cachix cache.
3. [Create a new secret](../../settings/secrets/actions/new) with the name `CACHIX_AUTH_TOKEN` and set its value to your auth token. If you are using a self-signed cache, you also need to create a `CACHIX_SIGNING_KEY` secret and set its value to your private signing key.

### Extra Nix Config (optional)
If you have additional configuration you want to append to `/etc/nix/nix.conf`, you can [create a new variable](../../settings/variables/actions/new) with the name `EXTRA_NIX_CONFIG`.
For example, if you want to configure nix to use additional substituters, set its value to the following:

```
extra-substituters = https://nix-community.cachix.org
extra-trusted-public-keys = nix-community.cachix.org-1:mB9FSh9qf2dCimDSUo8Zy7bkq5CX+/rkCWyvRCYg3Fs=
```

### Remote Builders (optional)
It is possible to configure nixpkgs-review-gha to use [remote builders](https://nix.dev/manual/nix/latest/advanced-topics/distributed-builds) either instead of or in addition to the local GitHub Actions runner.
For this to work, the GitHub Actions runner needs to be able to connect to your remote builders via SSH, and you need to configure an SSH keypair for authentication.

Set the following [secrets](../../settings/secrets/actions):

- `SSH_KEY`: A private ssh key which is authorized to access your remote builders. You can generate one using `ssh-keygen -t ed25519 -f ssh_key -N '' -C ''`.
- `SSH_CERT`: If you have configured an [SSH certificate authority](https://manpages.debian.org/unstable/openssh-client/ssh-keygen.1.en.html#CERTIFICATES), the certificate which authorizes your `SSH_KEY` to access the remote builders. You don't need to set this variable if you have authorized your `SSH_KEY` directly (i.e. added your public key to `authorized_keys` on the remote builder).
  <details>
  <summary>Example command to generate a shortlived certificate:</summary>

  ```shell
  ssh-keygen -Us $CA_PUBKEY_PATH \
    -I nixpkgs-review-gha \
    -n $REMOTE_USERNAME \
    -O clear \
    -O force-command="nix-daemon --stdio" \
    -V +1h \
    $PUBKEY_PATH
  ```

  </details>

Set the following [variables](../../settings/variables/actions):

- `BUILDERS`: A newline separated list of build machines in the same format as the [`builders` option in `nix.conf`](https://nix.dev/manual/nix/latest/command-ref/conf-file#conf-builders). You will need to set the value of the third field (ssh identity) to `/etc/nix/ssh_id` which is where your `SSH_KEY` is placed. Your `SSH_CERT` should be picked up automatically, if you have configured one.

For example, you can set `BUILDERS` to the following if you want to build on the [nix-community builders](https://nix-community.org/community-builders/). Keep in mind that these builders should generally [not be trusted](https://nix-community.org/community-builders/#notes-on-security-and-safety), so be careful with what you might push into the [binary caches](#push-to-attic-cache-optional) you configured above.

```

### Shortcuts on nixpkgs PR pages (optional)
Add [`shortcut.user.js`](shortcut.user.js) as a userscript in your browser for `https://github.com/` for example using the [User JavaScript and CSS chrome extension](https://chromewebstore.google.com/detail/user-javascript-and-css/nbhcbdghjpllgmfilhnhkllmkecfmpld) or [Violentmonkey](https://violentmonkey.github.io/).

The userscript assumes that you forked this repository to your personal account without changing its name. However, if you forked the repo to an organization instead or used a custom repo name or if you would like to use a different repo you have access to, you need to explicitly configure the userscript by updating the `repo` constant at the top of the file to point to the repository you would like to use.

> [!TIP]
> Opening the [raw file](shortcut.user.js?raw=true) with Violentmonkey installed will prompt for installation.

## Usage
1. Open the [review workflow in the "Actions" tab](../../actions/workflows/review.yml)
2. Click on "Run workflow"
3. Enter the number of the pull request in nixpkgs you would like to review and click on "Run workflow"
4. Reload the page if necessary and click on the review run to see the logs

## Experimental Features

### Identify still failing packages
If a package fails to build, try to build the same package again, but on the base branch (e.g. `master` or `release-XX.YY`).
If the package also fails to build on the base branch, it will be marked as "still failing" in the report to make it easier to see which build failures are unlikely to be caused by the PR being reviewed.
Note that these build failures still count towards whether the review is considered successful or not, so if you told nixpkgs-review-gha to automatically approve or merge the PR after a successful review and a package is "still failing" to build (even if all other packages have been built successfully), the PR is *not* approved/merged and you should inspect the build failure manually.

To enable this feature [create a new variable](../../settings/variables/actions/new) with the name `IDENTIFY_STILL_FAILING_PACKAGES` and set its value to `1`.

### Identify unsupported packages
If a package fails to build, try to detect whether the build failure was caused by a missing system feature.
For example, most hosted GitHub Actions runners cannot build QEMU/KVM based NixOS tests because they lack the `kvm` feature.
Trying to build a NixOS test on such a runner will always fail, so with this experimental feature enabled, packages that fail to build due to a missing system feature will be marked as "unsupported" and will NOT count towards review success/failure, i.e. if some packages are unsupported and all other packages have been built successfully, the PR *is* approved/merged automatically if you told nixpkgs-review-gha to do that.

This feature is enabled by default. To disable it [create a new variable](../../settings/variables/actions/new) with the name `IDENTIFY_UNSUPPORTED_PACKAGES` and set its value to `0`.
