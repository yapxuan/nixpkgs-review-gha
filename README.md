## Setup
1. [Fork](https://github.com/Defelo/nixpkgs-review-gha/fork) this repository.
2. In your fork, go to the [Actions](../../actions) tab and enable GitHub Actions workflows.
3. If you don't want to set up [automatic self-updates](#automatic-self-updates-optional), please disable the `self-update` workflow ([Actions / `self-update`](../../actions/workflows/self-update.yml) > `...` button (top right corner) > `Disable workflow`).

### Post Results / Auto Approve/Merge (optional)
If you want nixpkgs-review-gha to automatically post the results on the reviewed pull requests or automatically mark them as ready for review or approve/merge them, you need to generate a [personal access token](https://docs.github.com/en/authentication/keeping-your-account-and-data-secure/managing-your-personal-access-tokens):

1. Go to <https://github.com/settings/tokens> and generate a new **classic** token with the `public_repo` scope.
2. In your fork, go to "Settings" > "Secrets and variables" > "Actions" and [add a new repository secret](../../settings/secrets/actions/new) with the name `GH_TOKEN` and set its value to the personal access token you generated before.

### Automatic Self-Updates (optional)
If you want your fork to update itself on a regular basis, you need to generate a [personal access token](https://docs.github.com/en/authentication/keeping-your-account-and-data-secure/managing-your-personal-access-tokens). Note that this token is different from the one used above!

1. Go to <https://github.com/settings/personal-access-tokens> and generate a new **Fine-grained token** token with access to only your fork ("Repository access" > "Only select repositories") and "Read and write" permissions for both "Contents" and "Workflows".
2. In your fork, go to "Settings" > "Secrets and variables" > "Actions" and [add a new repository secret](../../settings/secrets/actions/new) with the name `GH_SELF_UPDATE_TOKEN` and set its value to the personal access token you generated before.

### Push to Attic Cache (optional)
Follow these steps if you want nixpkgs-review-gha to push new packages to an [Attic](https://github.com/zhaofengli/attic) cache. Replace `$CACHE` with the name of your cache (e.g. `nixpkgs`) and `$SERVER` with the url of your Attic server (e.g. `https://attic.example.com/`):

1. Generate a token with `push` and `pull` permissions: `atticadm make-token --sub nixpkgs-review-gha --validity 1y --pull $CACHE --push $CACHE`
2. [Create a new variable](../../settings/variables/actions/new) with the name `ATTIC_SERVER` and set it to the value of `$SERVER`
3. [Create a new variable](../../settings/variables/actions/new) with the name `ATTIC_CACHE` and set it to the value of `$CACHE`
4. [Create a new secret](../../settings/secrets/actions/new) with the name `ATTIC_TOKEN` and set its value to the token you generated before.

### Push to Cachix (optional)
Follow these steps if you want nixpkgs-review-gha to push new packages to a [Cachix](https://www.cachix.org/) cache. Note: If both an Attic cache and a Cachix cache is configured, the Attic cache is preferred and the Cachix configuration is ignored.

1. Go to https://app.cachix.org/ and set up your binary cache.
2. [Create a new variable](../../settings/variables/actions/new) with the name `CACHIX_CACHE` and set it to the name of your Cachix cache.
3. [Create a new secret](../../settings/secrets/actions/new) with the name `CACHIX_AUTH_TOKEN` and set its value to your auth token. If you are using a self-signed cache, you also need to create a `CACHIX_SIGNING_KEY` secret and set its value to your private signing key.

### Shortcuts on nixpkgs PR pages (optional)
Add [`shortcut.js`](shortcut.js) as a user script in your browser for `https://github.com/` for example using the [User JavaScript and CSS chrome extension](https://chromewebstore.google.com/detail/user-javascript-and-css/nbhcbdghjpllgmfilhnhkllmkecfmpld) or [Violentmonkey](https://violentmonkey.github.io/). Don't forget to update the `repo` constant at the top of the file to point to your fork.
